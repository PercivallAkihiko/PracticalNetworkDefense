The project done during the Practical Network defense was about securing a virtualized environment on Proxmox where two routers with OPNsense were deployed. Firewall rules were set via OPNsense, a VPN was created with OpenVPN, and SSH access was configured. An IDS was deployed and hardening operations performed.

Tools Used: Proxmox, OPNsense, IPsec, Graylog, Hardening;

Project includes:
-Network hardening
-Defense in depth
-Implementing IDS/IPS
-Implementing firewalls and virtual private networks (VPNs)
-Network monitoring
-Network traffic analysis
-Minimizing exposure (attack surface and vectors)
-Network access control (internal and external)
-Perimeter networks (demilitarized zones or DMZs) / Proxy Servers
-Network policy development and enforcement
-Network operational procedures
-Network attacks (e.g., session hijacking, man-in-the-middle)
