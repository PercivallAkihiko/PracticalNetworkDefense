The project done during the Practical Network defense was about securing a virtualized environment on Proxmox where two routers with OPNsense were deployed. Firewall rules were set via OPNsense, a VPN was created with OpenVPN, and SSH access was configured. An IDS was deployed and hardening operations performed.

Tools Used: Proxmox, OPNsense, IPsec, Graylog, Hardening;

## Task Completed:

- Network hardening  
- Defense in depth  
- Implementation of IDS/IPS  
- Configuration of firewalls and virtual private networks (VPNs)  
- Network monitoring  
- Network traffic analysis  
- Minimizing exposure (attack surface and attack vectors)  
- Network access control (both internal and external)  
- Perimeter networks (demilitarized zones, DMZs) / Proxy servers  
- Development and enforcement of network policies  
- Network operational procedures  
- Network attack mitigation (e.g., session hijacking, man-in-the-middle attacks)
